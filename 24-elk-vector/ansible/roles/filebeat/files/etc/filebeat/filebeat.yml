# ================================== Logging ===================================

# Sets log level. The default log level is info.
# Available log levels are: error, warning, info, debug
#logging.level: debug

# ============================== Filebeat modules ==============================

filebeat.config.modules:
  path: ${path.config}/modules.d/*.yml
  reload.enabled: false
  #reload.period: 10s

# ======================= Elasticsearch template setting =======================

#setup.template.settings:
#  index.number_of_shards: 1
#  index.codec: best_compression
  #_source.enabled: false

# =================================== Kibana ===================================

#setup.kibana:
#  host: "http://promvm-1.home.local:5601"
  #space.id:

# ================================= Dashboards =================================
# These settings control loading the sample dashboards to the Kibana index. Loading
# the dashboards is disabled by default and can be enabled either by setting the
# options here or by using the `setup` command.
#setup.dashboards.enabled: true

# ================================== Outputs ===================================

# ------------------------------ Logstash Output -------------------------------
output.logstash:
  # Boolean flag to enable or disable the output module.
  enabled: true

  # The Logstash hosts
  hosts: ["promvm-1.home.local:5044"]

  # Number of workers per Logstash host.
  #worker: 1

  # Set gzip compression level.
  #compression_level: 3

  # Configure escaping HTML symbols in strings.
  #escape_html: false

  # Optional maximum time to live for a connection to Logstash, after which the
  # connection will be re-established.  A value of `0s` (the default) will
  # disable this feature.
  #
  # Not yet supported for async connections (i.e. with the "pipelining" option set)
  #ttl: 30s

  # Optionally load-balance events between Logstash hosts. Default is false.
  #loadbalance: false

  # Number of batches to be sent asynchronously to Logstash while processing
  # new batches.
  #pipelining: 2

  # If enabled only a subset of events in a batch of events is transferred per
  # transaction.  The number of events to be sent increases up to `bulk_max_size`
  # if no error is encountered.
  #slow_start: false

  # The number of seconds to wait before trying to reconnect to Logstash
  # after a network error. After waiting backoff.init seconds, the Beat
  # tries to reconnect. If the attempt fails, the backoff timer is increased
  # exponentially up to backoff.max. After a successful connection, the backoff
  # timer is reset. The default is 1s.
  #backoff.init: 1s

  # The maximum number of seconds to wait before attempting to connect to
  # Logstash after a network error. The default is 60s.
  #backoff.max: 60s

  # Optional index name. The default index name is set to filebeat
  # in all lowercase.
  #index: 'filebeat'

  # The number of times to retry publishing an event after a publishing failure.
  # After the specified number of retries, the events are typically dropped.
  # Some Beats, such as Filebeat and Winlogbeat, ignore the max_retries setting
  # and retry until all events are published.  Set max_retries to a value less
  # than 0 to retry until all events are published. The default is 3.
  #max_retries: 3

  # The maximum number of events to bulk in a single Logstash request. The
  # default is 2048.
  #bulk_max_size: 2048

  # The number of seconds to wait for responses from the Logstash server before
  # timing out. The default is 30s.
  #timeout: 30s
